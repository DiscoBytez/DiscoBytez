# DiscoBytez
Is an Open sourced, easy to use Roblox application center using Discord Webhooks.
DiscoBytez may seem outdated compared to the likes of Hyra.Works and other centers, but we differenciate ourselves by being open-source, developer friendly, and 100% customizable. It requires no signup unless you don't have Discord, and we are always updating with features to make DiscoBytez

- More user friendly for both appliees and staff
- Easier to set-up
- Less exploitable
- More customizable

DiscoBytez is based off:

and the original NGHD's Graphics ordering center.
